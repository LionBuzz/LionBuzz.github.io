I believe most of you viewing this article have come across my previous article which describes how I got an opportunity to work at Versent. If not, you should probably check it out :).

The first few months at Versent was all about getting familiar about the AWS services we use everyday. I spent a fair bit of time in ACloudGuru and Linux Academy trying to get my first two certifications done; AWS Cloud Practitioner and AWS Solutions Architect Associate. It was tough because I wasn’t familiar with the services nor I had any past experience. But I made it past them within the first 2 and a half months of working at Versent. At that moment, I thought I had learnt so much and I will be able to do stuff on my own (totally underestimated the vast IT Industry at this point).

Then I was provided with an opportunity to work in an actual project, which was really the initial phase of my development and learning process. I spent a whole week in plannings for a new product that we are working on but I could only grab about 40% of what was being discussed in the meetings because I was unfamiliar with so much in the technology space that was being discussed in those meetings. That’s when I realized that although the certifications gave me an overview of most of the services used in the AWS space, I had no idea of how to actually put them together! And I noticed that we use acronyms heavily, so I would write them all down in my notebook and later get some feedback on those from an engineer. So you can guess, I had so many unknown unknowns and I was confused.

Then came questions from the engineer; he assessed my knowledge to see the level of maturity I had in regards to the ways of working and technologies used. The first question he asked was, “Do you know how to use GitHub for development?“. At this point, I am thinking, “TAFE has taught me a thing or two like how to commit and push to a repository, so I should be proficient enough to say yes at this point”. And so I said yes (not in a confident way). Immediately, the follow-up statement from him was, “Show me how you rebase”. Then I am like, I made the wrong decision to say yes. So, to show me how it’s done, he made me a little note to start with as you can see in the pictures below,

I would like to thank all the engineers in my team, and everyone in Versent family for being supportive along the way to this day! I appreciate everyone ! In the past year that I have been at Versent, I have always come to work happy and left with a smile on my face. This is what we all want, don’t we? We should be happy with everything we do and if we are not, there has to be something wrong and steps should be taken by ourselves to find the right job we want to do and be happy. “NO STRESS IS THE WAY TO GO!”

And then, after I started on the project, I started learning more and more everyday. I asked 100's of questions everyday and my fellow colleagues always supported and answered and helped me out! Kudos to you all! Everyday for me has been a opportunity to learn and grow, and I never let myself down, I have been learning and I will not stop! And hard work has paid off for me once again. At Versent, people are valued over anything else and this is just another example!

That’s it for now, let me know how you feel about the article. I just wanted to share my journey with people out there who have just started their journey in IT Industry. G’day!
