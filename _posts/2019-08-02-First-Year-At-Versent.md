Celebrating one year at Versent !!! :)

What an amazing time to be alive! Time really flies! A year ago, working in Hospitality at the airport, studying Networking at TAFE, I was constantly thinking about my career, what my future would look like in a few years to come.

The real story starts when our very own CTO James Coxon (The handsome guy in the picture below) was travelling back and forth from Sydney every second week or so. I did not know what he did, nor he knew that I was studying IT. After numerous encounters and conversations, after months of knowing him as our guest, I saw him working on his MacBook (lots of AWS stickers on the back) and decided to ask him if he could give me some advice on the future of IT and what I could do to ensure I take the right steps into the industry. Next week, I got a call for an interview at Versent which I recall as one of the most happiest days of my life. After I was hired, I asked him, "Why me?" He replied, "It's your attitude, one can teach technical skills to people but never attitude".

Versent is a company built on the foundation of culture and family, people here are valued more than work. I am blessed to have got an opportunity to work here, my first year has been amazing and this is just the beginning of endless opportunities that Versent has to offer. If you come to work everyday as a happy person and leave after learning so much everyday, you know you are in the right place at the right time! Thank you Versent and family for an amazing opportunity! 

An important lesson of life that I learnt, "Always be good to people, you never know when a person can change your life".
