This is my first ever blog and so I want to start with a little bit of personal background. I come from a networking background as I am nearly finished with my Bachelors of Information Technology (Network Security). I worked as a help desk professional for about 4 months and decided to move to a cloud based company “Versent” where my role is Associate Security and Identity Engineer. I have been in this company for 8 months now and I have gained insights  into Cloud based services like SaaS, PaaS, migrations, security, identity and so on.

I have been able to achieve CCNA, AWS Cloud Practitioner and Solutions Architect Certifications so far. AWS was new for me when I joined Versent but with lots of homework (Studying) and help of experienced engineers with real world experiences has totally changed my view of technology is the cloud. With so many businesses moving to cloud including hybrid clouds, it is for sure that “Cloud is the future!”.

Much of my recent projects has been focused on identity, security and infrastructure. I was not fluent in any of the programming languages so that has slowed me down but with daily exposure to languages in various forms, I am definitely improving. Python is my language of choice at the moment. I am planning to be comfortable with python first before moving into other languages.

I will be talking about my experiences with different projects and I will also include some example projects that I have started in this blog. Feel free to ask questions or give any advice via email or Linkedin. Thank you for taking some time to read this post!
